<p>You will be guided through the steps necessary to install this software.</p>

<p><strong>Please make sure you have your adapter unplugged from your computer when running this.</strong></p>

<p>
    This installer enables support for adapters that interpet devices reporting as GameCube controllers. Once installed, apps can attach and interpret signals from supported devices. Apps must build support in themselves in order to make use of functionality, but several apps exist that do this already.

<p>
    Any issues with this driver should be reported on the GitHub repository. Otherwise, enjoy!
