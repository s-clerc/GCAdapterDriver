    You hereby agree that you will not hold SecretKeys LLC responsible for any issues that arise from using the software outside of its intended deployment target and testing range (the aforementioned macOS versions). You will not hold SecretKeys LLC responsible for for any damage to adapters or otherwise; while we have not seen any reason to believe this could even happen, we recognize that life is strange, and thus this clause is here.
